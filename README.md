# Fundamentals of Data Analysis

The following assignment concerns data analysis in Python

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
```

## 01. Implementation of Counts function

> Python function called counts that takes a list as input and returns a dictionary of unique items <br> in the list as keys and the number of
times each item appears as values

## 02. Implementation of DiceRolls function

> Python function called dicerolls that simulates rolling dice. This function will take two parameters.<br> The number of dice k and the number of times to roll the dice n.

## 03. Coin Flipping Simulation

> Implementation of python program that
simulates flipping a coin 100 times. Then run this code<br> 1,000 times, keeping track
of the number of heads in each of the 1,000 simulations. And visualizing the simluation

## 04. Simpsonâ€™s paradox 
> Demonstration of simpson's paradox using python numpy linspace function.
